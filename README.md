## Future Changes: 
Plan on adding affects to top section "I'm a ...." that will cycle through my key skills & abilities.
Plan on editing project section:
  * Add tabs/filters to organize projects by type.
  * Add glow card affect to projects.
  * Add more projects.


## Known Issues:
Contact Form currently doesn't work due to not being able to access "Public ID".
  * Most likely out of date & code needs to be updated.
