My passion for game design and development is driven by my interest in programming and my eagerness to tackle new challenges. I excel at programming, debugging, and prototyping game mechanics. My professional experience in the VR/AR industry has honed my ability to quickly adapt and troubleshoot complex problems. In my previous role, I handled the porting, testing, and refactoring of VR applications, enhancing performance and resolving longstanding issues. In addition to revitalizing and debugging some legacy mobile AR applications, resulting in improved performance, and restoring functionality to their highest-earning AR mobile app. I am always looking for opportunities to further develop my skills.
