  description: "Hi, I’m Sam, a recent college graduate and aspiring Unity Developer.\nMy passion for game design and development is driven by my interest in programming and my eagerness to tackle new challenges. I excel in programming, debugging, and prototyping complex mechanics, and have hands-on experience in creating game assets ranging from art to sound effects.\nMy professional experience in the VR/AR industry has honed my ability to quickly adapt and troubleshoot complex programs in a timely manner. In my previous role, I managed the porting, testing, and refactoring of VR applications, enhancing performance and resolving longstanding issues. Additionally, I handled the revitalization and debugging of some legacy mobile AR applications, resulting in improved performance, and restoring functionality to their highest-earning AR mobile app. As a hardworking, dedicated, and quick learner, I’m always looking for opportunities to further develop my skills.\nI am open to any job opportunities that align with my skills and experience.\nIf you would like to contact me, please feel free to reach out via email by clicking the button above.",
