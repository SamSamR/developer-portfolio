My passion for game design & development is driven by my interest in programming & my eagerness to tackle new challenges. I excel at coding, debugging, & prototyping.

In addition, I revitalized & debugged legacy mobile AR applications, improving performance, & restored functionality to their highest-earning AR mobile app. I’m always looking for opportunities to further develop my skills.
